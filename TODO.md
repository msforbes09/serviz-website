# TODO

Deferred work. Add an entry the moment something is put off — see the working
rules in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Blocked on the user

- **Brand palette.** The theme is still shadcn's neutral `base-nova` default.
  Three colours are owed (primary, secondary, tertiary) before any UI work.
  The SERBIZ logo and flyers in `references/Images/` read as deep green, orange
  and light green. Applies to the `:root` and `.dark` blocks in
  `app/globals.css`.
- **Page designs.** Home, about, services, why us, FAQs and contact are
  placeholders. Sections get built under `modules/landing/` and
  `modules/site/`, not inline in a page.
## Housekeeping

- **Repository name spelling.** The remote is `msforbes09/serviz-website` while
  the brand, the package name and every string in `lib/site-config.ts` are
  SERBIZ with a b. Rename the repository if that was a typo; ignore this entry
  if it was deliberate.
- **Repository is public.** Nothing sensitive is committed today, but the
  contact form work will introduce a destination and possibly a key — those go
  in `.env`, never in the tree.

## Queued

- **Contact form.** Needs a destination decided (email, webhook or inbox) and
  a rate-limit key before the server action is written. Covered by the security
  self-review checklist in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Organization JSON-LD.** `lib/site-config.ts` already holds the legal name,
  contact points, mission and vision. Ship structured data with the real home
  page, using an escaping serializer rather than bare `JSON.stringify`.
- **Sitemap entries.** `app/sitemap.ts` lists only the home page. Every new
  public route is added there in the same change.
- **Shared UI blocks.** `AppFormField`, `PageHeader` and `EmptyState` are not
  built yet. Add each one when the first real use appears, not before.
